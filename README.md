# Ruby-ai4r

This is a demo project showcasing the usage of the ai4r Ruby gem for artificial intelligence.

## Introduction

The ai4r gem is a Ruby library for implementing various machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques. It provides easy-to-use interfaces for training models, making predictions, and evaluating performance.

This project serves as a demonstration of how to utilize the ai4r gem in a Ruby application to classify fruits based on selected properties.

bundle install

## Usage: 

# Fruits Classification
This project includes a form where the user can select properties such as color, size, and texture of a fruit. Based on the selected properties, the application evaluates the parameters and returns the predicted fruit.

# To classify a fruit:
