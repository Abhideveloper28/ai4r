# Ruby-ai4r

This is a demo project showcasing the usage of the ai4r Ruby gem for artificial intelligence.

## Introduction

The ai4r gem is a Ruby library for implementing various machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques. It provides easy-to-use interfaces for training models, making predictions, and evaluating performance.

This project serves as a demonstration of how to utilize the ai4r gem in a Ruby application to classify fruits based on selected properties.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Ruby (version 3.0.0)
- Bundler (for managing gem dependencies)

### Installation

# Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Abhideveloper28/ai4r.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd Ruby-ai4r

# Install dependencies using Bundler:
bundle install

## Usage: 

To run the demo, execute the following command:
ruby ruby-ai4r

This will execute the demo script, which showcases various functionalities of the ai4r gem.

# Fruits Classification
This project includes a form where the user can select properties such as color, size, and texture of a fruit. Based on the selected properties, the application evaluates the parameters and returns the predicted fruit.

# To classify a fruit:

Run the demo script (ruby demo.rb).
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Fill out the form by selecting properties for the fruit.
Click on the "Classify" button.
The application will display the predicted class of the fruit.
